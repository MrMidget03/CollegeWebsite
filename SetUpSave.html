    <h1>Setting Up Your First Save</h1>

    <p>When you first launch the game, the first thing the game wants you to do is to create a manager. <br> You should see the screenshot below with a manager to the right.</p>

    <img src="Images/2CreateManager/PersonalInfo.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the create a manager screen with personal info form">

    <p>As you can see in the screenshot, you've got Personal Info, Body, Head, Attire, Ability Aids, and Accessories. You don't need to replicate yourself, but you can if you want to, as long as you create something 
    that you are happy with. Make sure you have ticked 'Teach me about key management concepts' as it gives you tutorials on almost everything in the game. <br> 
    Once you've created a manager, you should see a page that looks like the screenshot below, but without the club and their home kit.</p>

    <img src="Images/1SetUpSave/MainMenu.png" alt="Screenshot of the main menu without a club selected">

    <p>Select 'Start a New Game'. <br> 
    Once you have selected 'Start a New Game', you should see the screenshot below in the middle of the screen with five options: Career, Create-A-Club, Online Career, Fantasy Draft, and Versus.</p>

    <img src="Images/1SetUpSave/1SelectGameMode.PNG" alt="Screenshot showing game mode selection options: Career, Create-A-Club, Online Career, Fantasy Draft, and Versus">

    <p>As it's your first save, you should select Career. You can play the other options later when you have more experience with the game, and I suggest avoiding Create-a-Club, as it isn't that great. <br> 
    Now you should see the screenshot below in the middle of the screen.</p>

    <img src="Images/1SetUpSave/2ChooseClub.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the club selection screen">

    <p>This is where you select the club you want to manage. I recommend that the club you pick is either the one you support or one that is similar to PSG. The reason I say similar to PSG is because they are
    levels above the quality of the league, which makes it easier to manage. PSG is owned by Qatar, so they have unlimited funds, which means you don't need to keep track of the finances of the club, 
    and it will also help you sign good-quality players to improve the team. <br> Once you have selected the team you want to manage, click 'Choose Game Mode'. You should now see the screenshot below.</p>

    <img src="Images/1SetUpSave/2ChooseGameMode.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the game mode selection screen with Original, Real World, and Your World options">

    <p>There should be three options: Original, Real World, and Your World. I recommend selecting Original. <br> Click 'Advanced Set Up', do not click 'Quick Start', as it only loads up the country and league that your
    club is in and makes the game way too easy. <br> The game will then take a little bit of time to load the next screen, which should look like the screenshot below, but with different countries selected.</p>

    <img src="Images/1SetUpSave/2GameDetails.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the advanced setup screen with country and league details">

    <p>You should click the minus icon next to any other league that has loaded, so the only country that's there should be the one you're managing in. <br> Click on 'Add/Remove Leagues' and then you should see the
    screenshot below.</p>

    <img src="Images/1SetUpSave/3ChooseNations.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the nations selection screen to add/remove leagues">

    <p>All the nations you see are available in the base game; other leagues like Saudi Arabia are available with a custom database. <br> You should tick all nations that have a star next to them, as they 
    have an impact on the nation where your club is based. Once they are all selected, click on 'Confirm' in the bottom right corner. Now you should see the screenshot below, but depending on what club you 
    have selected, the nations may be different.</p>

    <img src="Images/1SetUpSave/4ActiveLeagues.PNG" alt="Screenshot showing active leagues after selecting nations">

    <p>Make sure every league is playable and that you have the lowest league selected. <br> In the top right-hand corner, you should see the screenshot below.</p>

    <img src="Images/1SetUpSave/4ApproximatePlayerCount.PNG" alt="Screenshot showing the approximate player count and PC performance grading">

    <p>This is related to the number of players and also a grading system of your PC compared with how many players there are. The more stars, the quicker your PC will simulate the game.</p>

    <img src="Images/1SetUpSave/4DropDownMenu.PNG" alt="Screenshot showing the drop-down menu to select advanced options">

    <p>Now click on the drop-down menu and then click 'Advanced...'. <br> Now you should see the screenshot below.</p>

    <img src="Images/1SetUpSave/5CustomSetUp.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the custom setup menu with the option to select large game setup">

    <p>Select 'Large'. <br> Click on the add button for nations. You should now see the screenshot below.</p>

    <img src="Images/1SetUpSave/5NationDropDownMenu.PNG" alt="Screenshot showing the nation drop-down menu to add a nation">

    <p>Now click on the nation that the club you are managing is based in. <br> Once you've done that, click beside the pop-up menu, and now you should see that the nation you have selected is now there.</p>

    <img src="Images/1SetUpSave/6NationAllBoxesTicked.PNG" alt="Screenshot showing all nation checkboxes ticked, with stars indicating performance impact">

    <p>As you can see in the screenshot, tick all the boxes, but keep an eye on the stars in the top right-hand corner. As you tick all the boxes, the total number of stars decreases. I recommend that you 
    have at least one full star.</p>

    <img src="Images/1SetUpSave/7EstimatedGameSpeed.PNG" alt="Screenshot showing estimated game speed with stars indicating PC performance">

    <p>For my PC, this setup is good with my specs; yours might be different. <br> Now if you look at the bottom of the screen, you will see the screenshot below.</p>

    <img src="Images/1SetUpSave/8AdvancedOptions.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the advanced options screen in the game setup">

    <p>Some of these options you will rarely use, but there is one that should be ticked, and that is 'Disable Player Attribute Masking'. Unless you don't want to know the stats of a player that isn't scouted (it makes 
    the game harder when not ticked). <br> So now that the save is set up, just click the (whatever name is on the button) button in the bottom right, and a pop-up will appear, as you can see in the screenshot below.</p>

    <img src="Images/1SetUpSave/8StartGame.PNG" alt="Screenshot showing the start game button in the game setup screen">

    <p>Click 'Start Game'. <br> After you have clicked 'Start Game', the next screen will have the screenshot below in the middle of the screen.</p>

    <img src="Images/1SetUpSave/9ManagerialStyle.PNG" alt="Screenshot showing managerial style selection screen to choose coaching badges and experience">

    <p>This is where you select what coaching badges and past playing experience your manager has. <br> Now tick the box where it says 'Suggest badge based on Paris SG' or whatever club's name you are managing, and 
    past experience based on Paris SG or whatever club's name you are managing. <br> Now click 'Confirm'.</p>

    <img src="Images/1SetUpSave/10BreakingNews.PNG" alt="Screenshot of breaking news screen after manager selection">

    <p>And look at that! You are now officially the manager of your chosen club. How exciting! <br> Nothing really important on this screen—just a blurb about the managerial appointment. Just click 'Next' in the top right
    corner.</p>

    <img src="Images/1SetUpSave/10InformationAboutClub.PNG" alt="Screenshot of information about the club after managerial appointment">

    <p>There are only a couple of things that are important to read, and that's the media prediction, as it gives a clue as to where the board expects you to finish, and Finances, as it shows your remaining transfer 
    budget and total wage budget, but not how much spare wage you have available. <br> Click 'Next'.</p>

    <img src="Images/1SetUpSave/10TeamReport.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the team report with the best 11 and squad information">

    <p>This screen just gives more useful information. It shows what the coaches' best 11 is (not always the actual best 11). There are bits of information either side of the goalkeeper in the best 11. They 
    cycle through Captain, Hot Prospect, Top Earner, Key Player, Squad Personality, and Top Scorer. <br> Click 'Next'.</p>

    <img src="Images/1SetUpSave/11BoardClubVision.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the board's club vision and objectives for the manager">

    <p>This screen is very important if you don't want to get fired. Now you have Board Culture (ignore). <br> Actionable Objectives (ignore some but not all), now the majority of these objectives are completed 
    by just winning games and trophies, except working within the wage budget, of course. <br> Informational Objectives just give you information on what the board wants to do from time to time. <br> The 5-Year Plan. 
    Now the 5-year plan shows the current vision/objectives that the board wants you to achieve as manager. If an objective is required, you kind of have to complete it to keep your job, unless it's in the board culture 
    and/or actionable objectives. This is because as long as you are delivering on the pitch, the board won't fire you for failing one or multiple of those objectives. <br> Click 'Next'.</p>

    <img src="Images/1SetUpSave/11SupporterClubVision.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the supporters' club vision showing expectations from the fanbase">

    <p>This is pretty much the same as the previous one, but it's from the supporters instead. Failing these won't necessarily get you fired as long as you keep the board happy, but different clubs are persuaded by 
    their fanbase more than others. <br> Click 'Next'.</p>

    <img src="Images/1SetUpSave/12Arrangements.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the arrangements screen to schedule press conferences and meetings">

    <p>Schedule a press conference to meet the media? <br> I recommend selecting 'No', as they are not that useful and just take up time, but if you want to be immersive, you can select 'Yes'. <br> Arrange 
    an intra-squad friendly to assess the squad when possible? <br> Select 'No'. You can select 'Yes' if you want, but only do that at the start of a season, otherwise, you will clog up the calendar and your players 
    will just get tired earlier in competitive matches. <br> Arrange a meeting with backroom staff? <br> Since this is your first save, select 'Every Fortnight', as the meetings have useful recommendations from your 
    staff members. <br> Click 'Next'.</p>

    <img src="Images/1SetUpSave/12SaveGame.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the save game screen where you name your save and click save">

    <p>Now all you have to do is name your save file and select 'Save'. Once you've done that, the first tutorial should begin. Once you have completed them all, come back here for ways in which you can enhance your 
    managerial skills by reading our tips. Starting with <a href="Staff.html">Staff!!!</a> </p>
