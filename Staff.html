    <h1>Staff Tips</h1>

    <h2>Hiring Staff</h2>

    <p>Locate the Staff tab on the side of the screen. <br> Now, click on the Staff tab.</p>

    <img src="Images/2Staff/1Staff.png" alt="Screenshot showing the staff tab in the game interface">

    <p>Once you have clicked on the Staff tab, you should see the screenshot below on that page.</p>

    <img src="Images/2Staff/2PlaceAdvert.png" alt="Screenshot of the place advert option for staff hiring">

    <p>You have coaching, recruitment, and medical teams. If you have any spaces available, you will see a person icon with no colour in it. As you can see, I have a scout position available, so I'm going to place an advert for people to apply for it. To do that, I click on the person icon with the plus next to it and hover over place advert, which the scouting positions should appear, and then click on it. Once you've done that, you will need to simulate a week or two to receive some applicants.</p>

    <img src="Images/2Staff/2ResponseToAdvert.png" alt="Screenshot showing the response to a staff advert with applicants listed">

    <p>Now that I have some applications, I will review their attributes to see who is best suited for the scouting position.</p>

    <img src="Images/2Staff/3JudgingPlayerPotential.png" alt="Screenshot of scouting applicant attributes, focusing on judging player potential">

    <p>This is a close-up of their attributes. As this is a scouting position, sort the list by 'Judging Potential'. The reason I recommend focusing on potential is because that's how your squad improves â€” by signing young players with high potential and playing them.</p>

    <h2>Staff Responsibilities</h2>

    <img src="Images/2Staff/4Responsibilities.png" alt="Screenshot showing staff responsibilities options in the game interface">

    <p>Click on the 'Responsibilities' drop-down menu and select the 'Staff' option. <br> Now, scroll down until you see the screenshot below.</p>

    <img src="Images/2Staff/5HiringAndFiringStaff1.png" alt="Screenshot showing the option to take control of hiring and firing staff">

    <p>Click on 'Take control of all yourself', then select 'Set all to recommend staff member'.</p>

    <img src="Images/2Staff/5RecommendedStaffMember.png" alt="Screenshot showing the recommended staff member for a responsibility">

    <p>Once you have done that, you will see that the staff member has changed for that responsibility. <br> The screenshot below shows what type of staff member should take up each of the responsibilities.</p>

    <img src="Images/2Staff/6HiringAndFiringStaff2.png" alt="Screenshot showing assigned staff members for different responsibilities in the game">

    <p>One important step to ensure the changes are saved is to click the 'Confirm' button in the bottom right corner.</p>

    <img src="Images/2Staff/7Confirm.png" alt="Screenshot of the confirm button to save changes to staff responsibilities">

    <p>Once clicked, you should see the 'Confirm' button become less visible. That is how you know when the changes have been saved.</p>

    <img src="Images/2Staff/8SelectionAdvice1.png" alt="Screenshot showing the staff selection advice feature in the game">

    <p>If you see any responsibilities with the 'Delegate' button available, it means the staff member assigned to that responsibility isn't the best option. The reason for this happening is that you don't actually have that staff role hired. For example, in that screenshot, I recently changed my assistant manager, so it defaulted the 'Provides team selection advice' (Arbroath) responsibility to my Head of Youth Development.</p>

    <img src="Images/2Staff/8SelectionAdvice2.png" alt="Screenshot showing the delegate button and its function for selecting staff in the game">

    <p>Once I clicked 'Delegate', it changed to my assistant manager, and the 'Delegate' button became unavailable. To save the change, I clicked 'Confirm'.</p>
